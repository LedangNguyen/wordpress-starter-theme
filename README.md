# WordPress Starter Theme

Just another WordPress Starter Theme. Note that this theme is just a boilerplate and is meant to be used by developers to make projects from scratch. There are no builders, such as Elementor, etc.

## Installation

Just clone this repository to your **wp-content/themes** folder and activate it in **Themes** menu. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) has to be installed for assets compiling (CSS, JS).

## Usage (Yarn example)

```bash
# Install all dependencies
yarn

# Start developing
yarn dev

# Make a production build
yarn prod
```

## What's inside

- [Laravel Mix 6](https://laravel-mix.com/) for assets compiling
- [SCSS (Sass)](https://sass-lang.com/) is used as a preprocessor for CSS
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting JavaScript
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) for linting CSS
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) for transforming CSS
- [PostCSS Preset Env](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-preset-env) for using some of the modern CSS features that are not globally supported yet, such as Custom Media Queries, Custom Selectors and also Autoprefixer for cross-browser support
- [css-mqpacker](https://github.com/hail2u/node-css-mqpacker) for merging CSS Media Queries
- [Modern Normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize) for normalizing browsers' default styles
- [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) â€“ The Most Modern Mobile Touch Slider
- and more: there are a lot of useful WordPress helpers and JavaScript functions (mostly my commonly used). Also, the theme comes with some of pre-configured settings and cleanups. Please, explore the theme to know more.
